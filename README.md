steps for setting up an Asterisk VOIP server on Ubuntu, configuring SIP softphones, and adding users. Here's a summary of the steps you've listed:

Step 1: Update your package list:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update -y
Step 2: Install Asterisk:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install asterisk -y
Step 3: Start the Asterisk CLI:

bash
Copy code
sudo asterisk -r
Step 4: Backup Asterisk configuration files (extensions.conf, sip.conf, voicemail.conf):

bash
Copy code
sudo cp /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf.backup
sudo cp /etc/asterisk/sip.conf /etc/asterisk/sip.conf.backup
sudo cp /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf.backup
Step 5: Edit configuration files (extensions.conf, sip.conf, voicemail.conf) using nano:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/asterisk/sip.conf
sudo nano /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf
sudo nano /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf
Step 6: Reload Asterisk to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo asterisk -r
reload
Step 7: Check SIP peers (users):

bash
Copy code
sudo asterisk -r
sip show peers
Step 8: Add SIP users (7001 and 7002) to the configuration files.

Step 9: Download and install MicroSIP softphone on Windows and configure it with user 7001.

Step 10: Download MizuDroid on a mobile phone and configure it with user 7002.

Step 11: Check SIP peers again to verify that the server is set up with two users.

It's a good guide for setting up an Asterisk-based VOIP server and connecting SIP softphones. You can use these steps to create a blog or a README file for your GitHub repository to help others set up a similar environment. Make sure to provide additional details and explanations for each step and any specific configuration settings.
